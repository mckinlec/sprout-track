# Sprout Track

> **🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY UPDATE - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**
>
> **All users of Sprout Track must upgrade to version 0.96.30 immediately** due to a critical React Server Components vulnerability (CVE-2025-66478) that allows remote code execution. This vulnerability affects Next.js applications using React Server Components with the App Router.
>
> **What you need to know:**
> - **Affected versions**: All versions prior to 0.96.30
> - **Fixed version**: Version 0.96.30 (includes Next.js 15.5.7 with security patches)
> - **Severity**: Critical (CVSS 10.0) - Remote Code Execution vulnerability
> - **Docker users**: A new patched image has been deployed to `sprouttrack/sprout-track:latest`
>
> **Required actions:**
> - **Docker users**: Follow the Docker upgrade steps below
> - **Local installations**: Follow the manual upgrade steps below
> - **All users**: Do not delay this update - your application is vulnerable until upgraded
>
> **Docker Upgrade Instructions:**
>
> 1. **Backup your database**: Navigate to `/family-manager` in your browser, log in, and download your database backup from the settings page.
>
> 2. **Pull the latest patched image**: `docker pull sprouttrack/sprout-track:latest`
>
> 3. **Restart your container**: Stop and start your container to use the new image (e.g., `docker-compose down` then `docker-compose up -d`).
>
> 4. **Restore your database if prompted**: When the new container starts up existing data should automatically migrate if your previous version was after v.0.94.89. If you see the setup wizard use the import feature to restore your database backup file.
>
> **Manual Upgrade Instructions for Local Installations:**
>
> 1. **Backup your database and environment file**:
>    - Database: `db/baby-tracker.db`
>    - Log database (if used): `db/api-logs.db`
>    - Environment file: `.env`
>
> 2. **Completely remove your existing project directory** and re-clone the repository from GitHub to get the latest code with security patches.
>
> 3. **Follow the standard setup procedure** as described in the [Getting Started](#getting-started) section of this README.
>
> 4. **Restore your backed-up database and `.env` file** to the new installation.
>
> **Alternative**: You can use `./scripts/deployment.sh` which automates the backup and rebuild process (without deleting the directory).
>
> For more details about the vulnerability, see: [Next.js Security Advisory CVE-2025-66478](https://nextjs.org/blog/CVE-2025-66478)

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTICE - Version 0.94.89 Upgrade**
>
> **Admin passwords will be automatically reset to default "admin" when upgrading from v0.94.24 or earlier.** In attempt to smooth over upgrades for self-hosters that use Docker the /family-manager admin password will be reset to defaults during the import process for new installations.  If you manually save/restore your database backup and envirnoment file before the  upgrade and do not use the import utility then you will not be affected. [Read full details here](documentation/admin-password-reset-notification.md).

## Tech Stack

- Next.js with App Router
- TypeScript
- Prisma with SQLite (`/prisma`)
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Docker for containerization (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git (to clone the repository)
- Node.js (v22+) and NPM (v10+)
- Bash shell (for running the setup script)

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Oak-and-Sprout/sprout-track.git
cd sprout-track
```

2. If deploying to a restricted directory (like /var/www), set proper permissions:
```bash
# For standard web server directories like /var/www
sudo chown -R $(whoami):$(whoami) .
# Or specify your web server user (e.g., www-data)
# sudo chown -R www-data:www-data .
```

3. Give execute permissions to the scripts folder:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
```

4. Run the setup script:
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

This setup script will:
- Install all dependencies
- Generate the Prisma client
- Run database migrations
- Seed the database with initial data (default PIN: 111222)
- Build the Next.js application

After setup completes, you can run the application in development or production mode as instructed in the setup output.

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to set up manually or the setup script doesn't work for your environment:

1. Ensure Node.js (v22+) and NPM (v10+) are installed

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Generate Prisma client:
```bash
npm run prisma:generate
```

4. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run prisma:migrate
```

5. Seed the database:
```bash
npm run prisma:seed
```
### To run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### To run the production server:
1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```
2. Run the production server:
```bash
npm run start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Default Security PIN and Family-Manager Password

The default security PIN after setup is: **111222**

Default [/family-manager](/family-manager) password is: **admin**
Note: The family manager settings page is where you can set domain, whether to use https://, email settings, and download the database.  **It's recommended you download the database before each upgrade.**

## Initial Application Setup

After installation, when you first access the application, you'll be guided through a setup wizard that helps you configure the essential settings for your Sprout Track instance.

### Setup Wizard

The application includes a built-in Setup Wizard (`src/components/SetupWizard`) that walks you through the following steps:

1. **Family Setup**
   - Enter your family name and link/slug
   - On initial setup you can import data from a previous version (just import the old *.db file from the /db folder)

2. **Security Setup**
   - Choose between a system-wide PIN or individual caretaker PINs
   - For system-wide PIN: Set a 6-10 digit PIN
   - For individual caretakers: Add caretakers with their own login IDs and PINs
     - First caretaker must be an admin
     - Each caretaker needs a 2-character login ID and 6-10 digit PIN

3. **Baby Setup**
   - Enter baby's information (first name, last name, birth date, gender)
   - Configure warning times for feeding and diaper changes
   - Default warning times: Feed (2 hours), Diaper (3 hours)

The Setup Wizard ensures your application is properly configured with the necessary security settings and initial data before you start tracking your baby's activities.



## Available Scripts

### Next.js Server/Dev Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm start` - Start production server
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint

### Customizing Port Numbers

By default, the application runs on port 3000. To change the port:

1. Open `package.json` in your preferred text editor
2. Locate the "scripts" section
3. Modify the "dev" and/or "start" scripts to include the `-p` flag followed by your desired port number:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev -p 4000",  // Development server will run on port 4000
  "start": "next start -p 8080"  // Production server will run on port 8080
}
```

This change will persist across application updates. For Docker deployments, use the PORT environment variable as described in the Docker section.

### Database Scripts

#### Main Database (baby-tracker.db)
- `npm run prisma:generate` - Generate Prisma client
- `npm run prisma:migrate` - Create and apply new migration (prompts for name)
- `npm run prisma:deploy` - Apply existing migrations (no prompts, for production)
- `npm run prisma:seed` - Seed the database with initial data
- `npm run prisma:studio` - Open Prisma Studio to view/edit database

#### Log Database (api-logs.db)
- `npm run prisma:generate:log` - Generate log database Prisma client
- `npm run prisma:push:log` - Sync log schema to database (no migrations, for simple schemas)
- `npm run prisma:studio:log` - Open Prisma Studio to view/edit log database

**Development workflow:**
- When you change the main schema, run: `npm run prisma:migrate`
- When you change the log schema, run: `npm run prisma:push:log`
- The log database uses `db push` instead of migrations to avoid conflicts with the main database migrations folder

### Setup and Deployment Scripts

- `./scripts/setup.sh` - Complete initial setup (Node.js check, dependencies, database, build)
- `./scripts/env-update.sh` - Check and update environment configuration (creates ENC_HASH if missing)
- `./scripts/update.sh` - Update application (git pull, prisma operations, build)
- `./scripts/deployment.sh` - Full deployment process (backup + update + service management)
- `./scripts/backup.sh` - Create a backup of the application and database
- `./scripts/service.sh {start|stop|restart|status}` - Manage the application service

### Test Data Generation Scripts

- `./scripts/generate-test-data.sh` - Interactive test data generation with customizable parameters
- `./scripts/generate-test-data-automated.sh` - Automated test data generation (for cron jobs/CI/CD)
- `./scripts/generate-test-data.js` - JavaScript data generation logic

### Database Migration Scripts

- `./scripts/family-migration.js` - Migrate existing data for multi-family support
- `./scripts/family-update.sh` - Update database after multi-family migration
- `./scripts/ensure-utc-dates-improved.js` - Convert all database dates to UTC format

### Admin Scripts

- `node scripts/reset-admin-password.js` - Reset the system administrator password
  - This script allows you to reset the admin password stored in the AppConfig table
  - Only works with existing configurations (will not create new data)
  - Uses the same encryption utilities as the main application
  - Requires confirmation of the new password
  - Must be run from the project root directory

### Updating the Application

**1. Backup your data:**
Before upgrading, it is **critical** to back up both your database and environment configuration:
- **Database**: Download your `baby-tracker.db` file from the settings page in either the main app or the family manager pages.
- **Environment File**: For Docker deployments, your `.env` file (including encryption keys) is now stored persistently. While this survives container updates, it's still recommended to back up your environment settings.

**2. For Docker deployments:**

**Important**: Starting with version 0.94.24+, Docker deployments use persistent volumes for both database and environment files. This means your settings (including encryption keys) will survive container updates.

For **new Docker installations** (version 0.94.24+):
- Your `.env` file and database are automatically persisted in Docker volumes
- Upgrades preserve your settings without manual intervention
- Simply pull the latest image and restart the container

For **existing Docker installations** upgrading to 0.94.24+:
1. **Before upgrading**: Back up your current `.env` file if you have custom settings
2. Stop the old container
3. Pull the latest Docker image (`docker pull sprouttrack/sprout-track:latest`)
4. Update your `docker-compose.yml` to use the new volume structure (if using custom compose file)
5. Start the new container
6. If needed, restore any custom environment settings through the family manager interface

For **Docker upgrades** (version 0.94.24+):
```bash
# Stop the current container
docker-compose down

# Pull the latest image
docker pull sprouttrack/sprout-track:latest

# Start with updated configuration
docker-compose up -d
```

Your database and environment settings will automatically persist across updates.

**3. For local (non-Docker) builds:**
- Run the deployment script:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/deployment.sh
  ```
  This script will handle all necessary updates and migrations. You do **not** need to re-import your database, as the script manages updates in place.

### Docker Volume Management

Starting with version 0.94.24+, Docker deployments use named volumes for data persistence:

- `sprout-track-db`: Stores your SQLite database
- `sprout-track-env`: Stores your environment configuration (including encryption keys)

**To view your Docker volumes:**
```bash
docker volume ls | grep sprout-track
```

**To backup Docker volumes manually:**
```bash
# Backup database volume
docker run --rm -v sprout-track-db:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/database-backup.tar.gz -C /data .

# Backup environment volume
docker run --rm -v sprout-track-env:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar czf /backup/env-backup.tar.gz -C /data .
```

**To restore Docker volumes:**
```bash
# Restore database volume
docker run --rm -v sprout-track-db:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar xzf /backup/database-backup.tar.gz -C /data

# Restore environment volume
docker run --rm -v sprout-track-env:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine tar xzf /backup/env-backup.tar.gz -C /data
```

## API Logging

Sprout Track includes an optional API logging system for debugging and monitoring. API logging is **disabled by default**. To enable it:

```env
ENABLE_LOG=true
LOG_DATABASE_URL="file:../db/api-logs.db"
```

### Log Database Management

The API log database (`api-logs.db`) is managed separately from the main application database:

- **Schema Management**: Uses `prisma db push` instead of migrations for simplicity
- **Setup**: Automatically created during initial setup via `./scripts/setup.sh`
- **Updates**: Run `npm run prisma:push:log` to sync schema changes
- **Data Persistence**: Log data is preserved during schema updates when possible
  - Adding fields: Safe, preserves existing logs
  - Removing/renaming fields: May cause data loss for those fields
  - For production: Back up `api-logs.db` before schema changes if log history is important

**Note**: Since logs are typically ephemeral debugging data, the log database uses a simpler schema sync approach rather than versioned migrations. This avoids migration conflicts with the main database.

See [app/api/utils/logging.README.md](app/api/utils/logging.README.md) for complete documentation.

## Environment Variables

The application can be configured using environment variables in the `.env` file. Here are the available options:

| Variable | Description | Default | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Path to the SQLite database | `"file:../db/baby-tracker.db"` | `"file:/path/to/custom/db.sqlite"` |
| `LOG_DATABASE_URL` | Path to the API log database | `"file:../db/api-logs.db"` | `"file:/path/to/logs.db"` |
| `ENABLE_LOG` | Enable API request/response logging | `"false"` | `"true"` |
| `SERVICE_NAME` | Name of the systemd service | `"baby-tracker"` | `"sprout-track"` |
| `AUTH_LIFE` | Authentication token validity period in seconds | `"86400"` (24 hours) | `"43200"` (12 hours) |
| `IDLE_TIME` | Idle timeout before automatic logout in seconds | `"28800"` (8 hours) | `"3600"` (1 hour) |
| `APP_VERSION` | Application version | `"0.9.0"` | `"1.0.0"` |
| `COOKIE_SECURE` | Whether cookies require HTTPS connections | `"false"` | `"true"` |
| `ENC_HASH` | Encryption hash for admin password security | Auto-generated | 64-character hex string |

### Automatic Environment Setup

The `./scripts/env-update.sh` script automatically manages environment variables:
- Creates `.env` file if it doesn't exist
- Generates a secure `ENC_HASH` (64-character random hex) if missing
- Used during setup and deployment processes

### Important Notes:

- **DATABASE_URL**: Changing this after initial setup requires migrating your data manually.
- **AUTH_LIFE**: Lower values increase security but require more frequent logins.
- **IDLE_TIME**: Determines how long a user can be inactive before being logged out.
- **ENC_HASH**: Automatically generated for admin password encryption; do not modify manually.
- **COOKIE_SECURE**:
  - Set to `"false"` to allow cookies on non-HTTPS connections (development or initial setup)
  - Set to `"true"` when you have an SSL certificate in place (recommended for production)
  - When set to `"true"`, the application will only work over HTTPS connections

## Home Assistant Integration

Sprout Track includes a full Home Assistant integration for smart home dashboards and hands-free voice control.

### Sensors and Services

Install the custom integration from `custom_components/sprout_track/` to get:

- **16 sensors per baby** — last feed, last diaper, feeds today, diapers today, total bottle oz, sleep status, last bath, last medicine, mood, weight, height, temperature, head circumference, last pump, last play, last note
- **1 binary sensor** — sleeping on/off
- **7 services** — log_bottle, log_nursing, log_diaper, log_sleep_start, log_sleep_end, log_medicine, log_bath

Setup: Copy the `custom_components/sprout_track/` folder to your HA config directory, restart HA, then add the integration via Settings > Devices & Services.

### Voice Commands via LLM

With an Ollama (or similar) conversation agent in HA, you can use natural language to log activities and query baby status:

- *"Log a bottle"* → asks how many ounces → logs it
- *"River went to sleep"* → asks nap or bedtime → logs it
- *"River is awake"* → ends sleep session
- *"I'm starting to pump"* → starts pump session with 15-minute timer
- *"When was the last diaper change?"* → queries live data and answers naturally
- *"How many bottles today?"* → reports total count and ounces

The integration uses HA Scripts exposed as LLM tools via the Assist API. See [docs/ha-integration-guide.md](docs/ha-integration-guide.md) for the complete setup guide.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/ha/status` | GET | Structured JSON baby status (for sensors, polled every 60s) |
| `/api/ha/query` | GET | Human-readable baby status summary (for LLM voice queries) |
| `/api/voice/log` | POST | Log activities: bottle, breast, diaper, sleep, wake, medicine, bath, pump |

All endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer {device_token}` header. Create device tokens in the Sprout Track Settings UI.
